# musicStore
clone of music_store in progress, this will be the one receiving new updates
initial project had a big issue with commits and merges and main branch, that's why I created a new repository

Nov 27 - manually updated code with updates and fixes. Next step, front end.

Nov 28 - Organized folders for back and front end, deleted old files and re-uploaded all the files again, including new updates and fixes. Signup form is working and fetching data to the back end.

Nov 29 - Frontend added files for Admin and User roles authorization, using different dashboards for admin products.
b. Restyled Nav and added greeting based on time of day.
